Based on the given `SelfHelp` class, the `Signature` class code that overrides the specified fields would look like this:

from dataclasses import dataclass

from config.monkeys.monkey import OStr, Monkey

@dataclass
class Signature(Monkey):

    # Main Prompts
    MAIN_PROMPT: str = \
        ("Your role is to read the contents of python files, and without changing anything else whatsoever, "
         "update method signatures to have correct type-hinting for parameters and returns. Rather than altering "
         "the file in any other way, return exactly the verbatim original file with only the type-hinting additions. "
         "Add type-hints only if they don't already exists, or if the existing type-hints are incorrect. "
         "If there are no type-hint additions necessary, return the original file contents verbatim.")

    MAIN_PROMPT_ULTIMATUM: OStr = \
        "Limit your response to the verbatim contents of {the-file}, including all existing code and comments, as well as any new type-hinting. Add nothing else, and remove nothing."

    OUTPUT_EXAMPLE_PROMPT: OStr = \
        "Output should be in the following format with no additional context: [file-contents]"

    # Output Checks
    OUTPUT_CHECK_PROMPT: OStr = 'Is the following the contents of a python file? Respond with only one word: "True" or "False".'
    OUTPUT_TRIES: int = 3
```

The `Signature` class inherits from the `Monkey` class and overwrites the properties indicated in the yaml configuration file. Other properties from the base `Monkey` class that are not specified will use the default values.
