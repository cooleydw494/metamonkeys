comment-monkey:

  # Prompts
  MAIN_PROMPT: "Please add code comments to document the following file: {the-file}. Use PEP8 style docstrings for functions and classes, and single-line comments for other code. Focus on readability and clarity. Rather than include verbose comments, try to make comments elegant and concise. You may add new comments, new docstrings, and edit existing comments. You may also re-order code, but do not add or remove code. If there is no value to adding/altering comments, return the original file verbatim."
  MAIN_PROMPT_ULTIMATUM: "Limit your response to the verbatim contents of {the-file}, including all existing code and comments, as well as any new or altered comments you add. Do not add comments that are not genuinely helpful."
  OUTPUT_EXAMPLE_PROMPT: "Limit your output strictly to the updated contents of the file, including nothing else, like this: [complete contents of file]"

Only add docstring where they are genuinely useful, rather than adding them just because you can. If there are no docblock additions that are genuinely helpful, return the original file contents verbatim."
  MAIN_PROMPT_ULTIMATUM: "Limit your response to the verbatim contents of {the-file}, including all existing code and comments, as well as any new docstring. Always write docstring in the Google style, notating params/returns in a way IDEs understand. Add nothing else, and remove nothing."
